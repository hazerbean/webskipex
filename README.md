Web Skip Ex
===========

Example code from Web Script Programming.

This repository illustrates the steps taken in the creation
of the 2012 Web Script programming example code.  For 'realism' Kit
and I purposefully worked in a loosely coupled fashion.  Kit telling
me roughly what was needed for his project.  I then started my code
(which is what you see here) and then integrated it with his code when
he made it available.  The steps taken align with the various branches
and merges seen in this repo.

The aim is to provide an example of how to work effectively within a
brown-field environment, where you cannot control all the options and
invent things from scratch to suit all your desires.

Customer work is so very rarely green-field building expereince!
