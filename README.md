Web Skip Ex
===========

This is the example code from my Web Script Programming unit.

This repository illustrates the steps taken in the creation
of the 2012 Web Script programming example code.  For 'realism' Kit
and I purposefully worked in a loosely-coupled fashion.  Kit telling
me roughly what was needed for his project.  I then started my code
(which is what you see here) and then integrated it with his code when
he made it available.  The steps taken (the commit history you can see) 
align with the various branches
and merges seen in this repo.

Our aim is to provide an example of how to work effectively within a
brown-field environment, where you cannot control all the options and
invent things from scratch to suit all your desires.  All this whilst
introducing everything that you need to have seen examples of before you 
start planning your coursework.  

It's necessarily rough-and-ready.  Customer work is so very rarely
a green-field building expereince, and this unit aims to provide a
level of realism.

Notes
-----
When possible, before being pushed here:

* HTML should be valid (HTML5)
* CSS should be valid (CSS level 3)
* JavaScript should:
 * work (i.e. nothing is funamentally broken and stubs are used for capabilities that are in-development)
 * give no errors in the console
 * give no errors in jslint.com (with browser assumed and console allowed)

You should adopt a similar approach to managing your own work: by regularly 
checking its validity and operational capability you'll write better code
in the first place.
