Web Skip Ex
===========

This is the example code from my Web Script Programming unit.

This repository illustrates the steps taken in the creation
of the 2012 Web Script programming example code.  For 'realism' Kit
and I purposefully worked in a loosely-coupled fashion.  Kit telling
me roughly what was needed for his project.  I then started my code
(which is what you see here) and then integrated it with his code when
he made it available.  The steps taken (the commit history you can see) 
align with the various branches
and merges seen in this repo.

Our aim is to provide an example of how to work effectively within a
brown-field environment, where you cannot control all the options and
invent things from scratch to suit all your desires.  All this whilst
introducing everything that you need to have seen examples of before you 
start planning your coursework.  

It's necessarily rough-and-ready.  Customer work is so very rarely
a green-field building expereince, and this unit aims to provide a
level of realism.

Back-to-Front
-------------
It is worth pointing out that despite the aim for realism, this is a
solution to a problem that has already been solved many times, and a
solution that is designed it backwards: i.e. it is a tool to introduce
JavaScript, PHP and MySQL concepts.  These concepts are discussed in the
lectures.  Hopefully the milestones and the order of checkins will provide
some insight, but they need to be taken twice daily with the lecture
content to make sense.  In summary, a real world solution would look 
different because we have an unwritten requirement of communicating how
and why each stage works.

Notes
-----
When possible, before being pushed here:

* HTML should be valid (HTML5)
* CSS should be valid (CSS level 3)
* JavaScript should:
 * work (i.e. nothing is funamentally broken and stubs are used 
   for capabilities that are in-development)
 * give no errors in the console
 * give no errors in jslint.com (with browser assumed and console allowed)

Students are encouraged to adopt a similar approach to managing 
their work.  Rregularly checking code validity and operational 
capability results in writing better code from the outset.
